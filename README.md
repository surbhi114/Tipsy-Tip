# Pre-work - Tipsy Tips

Tipsy Tips is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Surbhi Sharma

Time spent: 8 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see

the tip and total values.

* Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* UI animations

* Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)

* Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount

is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to

tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start

typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- You can modify the tip values to be displayed

- You can also modify the default tip value from settings

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- Since I am new to IOS application development. I had to google

most of the things.

- Many a times my Xcode would complaint about not being able to

attach to a pid (simulator)
